/*
    1. Create a generator function called "randomAmountFromRange"
       which has 3 parameters: amount, min, and max

    2. ^ This function will generate the amount of random numbers
       provided as an argument, between the min and max (inclusive)
       Eg: randomAmountFromRange(3, 10, 20) => 13, 12, 19

    3. Create a for...of loop that will loop through the following
       generator objects to test it:
       - randomAmountFromRange(3, 10, 20)
       - randomAmountFromRange(5, 100, 200)
       - randomAmountFromRange(10, 1000, 2000)
