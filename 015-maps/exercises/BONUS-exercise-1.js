/*
    1. Create a Map called "myConsole"
    
    2. Assign "myConsole" the key "log" with a value that is
       an arrow function.

       This arrow function will have one parameter called "message"

       The function will just console.log out the "message"

    3. Call the function with a message. How does this compare to Objects?

    4. Add the following key-value pairs to the map:
        -  1  : "number one"
        - "1" : "string one"

    5. Print out each of the 2 values for the keys you just added.
       How does this differ from an Object?
