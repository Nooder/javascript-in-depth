/*
    1. Create a class called "Bookstore"

    2. The "Bookstore" constructor has a single parameter
       called "books" which is an Array of Book Objects.
       Assign the argument passed in to the instance within
       the constructor.

    3. Create a "listBooks" method on the "Bookstore" class
       that will loop through and print out all the Books
       in the Store (assume they have a name and author)
       so you can format each like this:
       `${book.name} by ${book.author}`

    3. Create another class called "Book"

    4. The "Book" constructor has 2 parameters:
       - name
       - author
       Assign these to the instance within the constructor

    5. Create 2 Books:
       const nineteen84 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell")
       const hp = new Book("Harry Potter", "J.K. Rowling")

    6. Create a Bookstore:
       const bookstore = new Bookstore( [ nineteen84, hp ] )

    7. Call bookstore.listBooks() and make sure it works:
       1984 by George Orwell
       Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
